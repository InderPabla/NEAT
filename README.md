# NEAT : Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies
I wrote NEAT for C# and tested it in Unity3D enviroment. 

## Creature learns to to maximize distance travelled without dieing. 
- If creature touches the wall it does immediately
- If creature gets too near another creature it starts taking damage and does onces damage reaches 100 
- Creature is rewarded higher for traveling large distances (Position points are taken every second). 
- Creature is rewarded for having lower number of genetic connections (this proves better in the long run, simplest nets evolve)
